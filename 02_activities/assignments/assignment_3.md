# Data Visualization

## Assignment 3: Data Visualization Ethics

### Requirements:
- Let‚Äôs return to the data visualizations we evaluated for Assignment 2.  
- For each visualization: 
    - Explain (with reference to material covered up to date, along with readings and other scholarly sources, as needed) whether or not you think this data visualization is accessible, reproducible, and equitable. 
        ```

        Good (Historical Oil Prices):

        Bad (Only Murders in the Building):

        For the ‚Äúgood‚Äù visualization, I believe there are still issues with it being accessible, reproducible, and equitable. In terms of accessibility, the colours are too similar and when tested using a colour blindness simulator, it was very difficult to tell the difference between the price ranges. Each data point is very small and gets smaller as you get to the centre of the circle, which adds to the difficulty of reading it. I also tested this visualization using VoiceOver on my computer and my phone and it cannot be read by it. Someone with visual impairment would not be able to decipher this graphic at all. As mentioned in assignment 2, this visualization is not easily reproducible because it doesn‚Äôt cite where the raw data came from or how the data was gathered. This puts into question the accuracy and credibility of the information. Finally, I would not consider this graph to be entirely equitable. There is rightfully a big emphasis on the Middle East region, but oil reserves are found all over the world. Fluctuating oil prices effect every region on the planet and this visualization doesn‚Äôt show the broader implications of this. 
        
        For the ‚Äúbad‚Äù visualization, we also have issues with accessibility and equity. Similar to our good visualization, the colour contrast on this graphic is too low. It also relies heavily on pictures instead of words or other types of markers to convey its message. Finally, this visualization requires you to hover over each marker to reveal additional information. Altogether, this makes it difficult for someone with colour-blindness or visual impairment to see and interpret the information. The hovering feature makes it inaccessible to those who may not be able to look at this data on a computer. Or for whatever technical reason, the hovering doesn‚Äôt work and that extra data is lost to the reader. In terms of equity, the data comes from solely US sources and therefore is only visualizing an American point of view. It makes this visualization less relatable to people outside of North America especially if they‚Äôre not familiar with IMDB or the Emmys.

        ```
    - How could this data visualization have been improved (in terms of accessibility, reproducibility, equity)?  
        ```
        Your answer...

        For the oil price visualization, the first suggestion is to use high contrast and distinct colours for each price range. If possible, the heat map should be made larger or allow zooming to make it easier to see each marker. To increase accessibility for visually impaired people, there should be more alt text in this graphic so that it can be read by a screen reader. Finally, the data sources should be explicitly cited for reproducibility.
        
        For the visualization on ‚ÄúOnly Murders in the Building‚Äù, there also needs to be a change in colour scheme. High contrast, distinct colours should be used. For better interpretation and accessibility, there needs to be less emphasis on using pictures and the hovering feature. There should be more annotations and alt text to better explain the data and to make it accessible to people who rely on screen readers. Finally, to make this visualization more equitable, data should be pulled from international sources. In addition to using American sources of data, you can pull ratings information from countries all over the world.

        ```

- Word count should not exceed (as a maximum) 300 words for each visualization. 

### Why am I doing this assignment?:
- This ongoing assignment ensures active participation in the course, and assesses learning outcomes 2 and 3:  
* Apply general design principles to create accessible and equitable data visualizations
* Use data visualization to tell a story
