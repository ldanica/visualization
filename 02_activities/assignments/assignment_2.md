# Data Visualization

## Assignment 2: Good and Bad Data Visualization

### Requirements:

- Data visualizations are important tools for communication and convincing; we need to be able to evaluate the ways that data are presented in visual form to be critical consumers of information 
- To test your evaluation skills, locate two public data visualizations online, one good and one bad  
    - You can find data visualizations at https://public.tableau.com/app/discover or https://datavizproject.com/, or anywhere else you like! 
- For each visualization (good and bad):  
    - Explain (with reference to material covered up to date, along with readings and other scholarly sources, as needed) why you classified that visualization the way you did.
      ```
      Your answer...

      Good (Historical Oil Prices):

      Bad (Only Murders in the Building):
      https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/raisa.hannus/viz/OnlyMurdersintheBuildingDataPlusTV/OnlyMurdersInTheBuilding

      The visualization on oil prices is considered good because it‚Äôs very comprehensive. Spanning over 30 years, there is an abundance of data points in which to graph. It‚Äôs substantive and adds to the accuracy of this visualization. In addition, the information presented is aesthetically pleasing and is easy to understand. The main message of it is described concisely in the title (oil prices in dollars per barrel) as well as a small description about key historical events that effected oil prices. There is a legend that shows the price range and its corresponding colour and instructions on how to read the graph (start from the centre, clockwise direction). If the circular graph is too overwhelming, there‚Äôs a simple line graph that encompasses all relevant information while showing the price trends of the last 30+ years. If you were to have access to the raw data, it seems highly probable that you can reproduce either graphs. Finally, the explanations provided gives further context to the data and helps to guide the audience on the story it‚Äôs trying to tell. Whether you‚Äôre familiar with the subject or not, this visualization provides the audience with concise and detailed information that‚Äôs easy to interpret.

      The visualization about the show ‚ÄúOnly Murders in the Building‚Äù is considered bad. Firstly, it is not clear what the objective of this visualization is. Is it trying to tell us it‚Äôs a good show, that it wins a lot of awards, or who‚Äôs in the cast? It‚Äôs not obvious what the message the author of this graphic is trying to convey. Secondly, the methods used to present the data are not familiar chart types. The most familiar type is of the episode ratings, but even then it‚Äôs not obvious. The axes are missing, there‚Äôs an odd graphic inside each bar, and the labelling of the bars is inconsistent. Not every bar has the rating and some are labelled with a vote count. The cast list is not very intuitive and the instructions are not easily found. When you click on a window, the cast list seems to shuffle which adds to the confusion. This all adds cognitive load to our audience especially if they have never watched the show. I have watched this show and I don‚Äôt find this visualization easy to navigate or understand. 

      ```
    - How could this data visualization have been improved?  
      ```
      Your answer...
      
      Despite its comprehensiveness, the visualization on oil price could increase our audience‚Äôs cognitive load. A circular graph may not be a chart type that most people are familiar with. The colours used for the heat map are very similar and it may be beneficial to use more distinct colours to show the price ranges. The amount of information presented can be overwhelming. There also seems to be an emphasis on the Middle East despite Venezuela and Canada having significant oil reserves. That region does play a significant role in the oil industry, but if the intention is to present the data in an objective and neutral way, it would be best to keep it simple. The heat map can be kept as it‚Äôs a great visualization, but most of the information is shown in the line graph below. You could make a small mention of the highest and lowest historical prices or keep the small description already given. The rest of it can be removed. I found the timeline difficult to follow as the tick marks and corresponding descriptions don‚Äôt line up well. If this has to be included, it needs to be more clear and easy to follow. Finally, the data source wasn‚Äôt explicitly stated. This needs to be done for reproducibility.

      For ‚ÄúOnly Murders in the Building‚Äù, all the graph types need to be changed to something more simple and familiar. For the IMDB rating and votes, it can be kept as a bar graph, but there needs to be labelled axes. The ‚Äúbuilding‚Äù graphic within each bar needs to be removed as well because it unnecessarily increases cognitive load. Perhaps instead of labelling the ratings/votes on top of the bars, we could do a double bar graph where each episode will have a bar for the ratings and a bar for the votes. For the Top Cast List, it should be replaced with something like a network visualization or a heat map chart to show the relationships between all the cast members and the episodes. Depending on the objective, I would consider removing it altogether as I don‚Äôt see the relevance of it. As for visualizing the amount of Emmy Awards, I would change it to a win-loss sparkline type of chart. It‚Äôs easier to read each year line by line rather than the way it‚Äôs clustered now. You can also quickly determine by year how many Emmys were won and lost.

      ```
- Word count should not exceed (as a maximum) 500 words for each visualization (i.e. 
300 words for your good example and 500 for your bad example)
